Write a program to do basic string compression. 
For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.
Note:
Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal to 9.

Input Format:

The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.
Output Format:

The output contains the string after compression printed in single line.

def stringCompression(s):
    i = 0
    res = []
    while i < len(s):
        j = i + 1
        c = 1
        while j < len(s):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                c += 1
                j += 1

            else:
                break

        if c > 1:
            res.append(s[i])
            res.append(c)

        else:
            res.append(s[i])

        i = i + c

    for i in range(len(res)):
        print(res[i], end='')


s = input()
stringCompression(s)
